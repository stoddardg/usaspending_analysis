UTILIZING THE MAPPING TOOL AND GROUNDED THEORY AS A METHOD, THIS STUDY WILL COMBINE THE VOICES OF MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS WITH CLARITY AND OBJECTIVITY. THUS, THIS STUDY WILL ASSIST POLICY MAKERS BY OBJECTIVELY IDENTIFYING AND DEFINING ANY PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED, PRIORITIZING ISSUES FOR REFORM, AND FACILITATING THE DESIGNING OF A SOLUTION. A MAPPING TOOL WILL ENABLE INTERVIEW SUBJECTS TO IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE SPECIFIC PATHWAYS TO CARE THAT THEY FOUND BOTH HELPFUL AND CHALLENGING. THE INTERVIEWS WILL BE TRANSCRIBED, ANALYZED USING A GROUNDED THEORY APPROACH, AND CODED FOR THEMES TO SYNTHESIZE THEIR EXPERIENCES. THE ADVANCED STATE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE IN MARICOPA COUNTY MAKES IT AN IDEAL SITE TO EXAMINE THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF THE SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO PEOPLE IN CRISIS WITH AND WITHOUT POLICE. LESSONS LEARNED FROM MARICOPA CAN BE GENERALIZED FOR OTHER URBAN ENVIRONMENTS SEEKING TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL BE DISSEMINATED IN THREE WAYS, PRESENTATIONS, ARTICLES, AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. PRESENTATIONS WILL BE PREPARED FOCUSING ON LESSONS LEARNED REGARDING BROADER COMMUNITY RESPONSE TO CRISIS SITUATIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS AND SUBMITTED TO CONFERENCES SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE (IACP), CIT INTERNATIONAL, AND NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. IN ADDITION, A SERIES OF COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WILL BE PLANNED FOR DISSEMINATION AND FEEDBACK TO INFORM FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. IN LINE WITH THESE TALKS, MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE PREPARED AND SUBMITTED TO ACADEMIC AND LAY PUBLICATIONS FOR BROADER DISSEMINATION. FINDINGS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE PHOENIX CITY COUNCIL OR A SUBCOMMITTEE OF MEMBERS AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS.',\n",

MEXICAN DTOS ARE THE PRIMARY ORGANIZATIONAL THREAT TO THE STATE OF IOWA. METH CONTINUES TO BE THE LARGEST PROBLEM DRUG IN OUR STATE. METH IS HIGHLY AVAILABLE IN THE STATE OF IOWA. METH TREATMENT ADMISSIONS HAVE STEADILY INCREASED OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS. DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING OF METH, SPECIFICALLY “ONE-POT” LABS REMAINS A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE A FRACTIONAL SUPPLY OF METH IN COMPARISON WITH THE MEXICAN DTOSIOWA HAS MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN DEALING WITH A METH EPIDEMIC THAT STARTED IN THE 1990S. WE HAVE, IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER BEGUN TO LOSE GROUND. SEIZURES ARE TRENDING UPWARD, SEIZURES ARE LARGER AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PURE, ARRESTS AND INCARCERATION RATES ARE INCREASING, AND USAGE RATES ARE BEGINNING TO TREND UP AGAIN. NOT ALL OF THE SLIPPAGE IN IOWA METH TRENDS HAS A LAW ENFORCEMENT SOLUTION, HOWEVER THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST FUNDING TO RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES FOR THE ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING 3 PRIORITIES: DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE OVERTIMEIOWA HAS ESTABLISHED A NETWORK OF DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCES THROUGH THE JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT (JAG). THERE ARE CURRENTLY 16 LOCAL TASK FORCES ALONG WITH ONE STATE TASK FORCE FUNDED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. LOCAL TASK FORCES AND THE IOWA DIVISION OF NARCOTICS ENFORCEMENT (DNE) HAVE AN EXCELLENT WORKING RELATIONSHIP. THE DNE ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT 85% OF THEIR CASES ARE EITHER WORKED JOINTLY WITH OR INITIATED AND HANDED OFF FROM LOCAL DRUG TASK FORCES. UNFORTUNATELY, THE BYRNE JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM HAS SEEN A 43% REDUCTION IN FUNDING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIZING. AS A RESULT, LOCAL ENFORCEMENT PROJECTS ARE FORCED TO PRIORITIZE CASES. WHILE LOCAL OFFICERS ARE INCLINED TO WORK CASES TO THEIR HIGHEST POTENTIAL, PRESSURE FROM THE COMMUNITY REQUIRES THAT THEY FOCUS ON CASES WITH A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITY. GRANT FUNDING IS REQUESTED TO SUPPORT TASK FORCES IN A WAY THAT ENCOURAGES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CASES WHICH CAN BE WORKED UP THE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. INTELLIGENCE SHARINGTHE TRANSIENT NATURE OF THE DRUG TRADE NECESSITATES THE NEED FOR MULTIJURISDICTIONAL DRUG ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCES AND EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SHARING. TASK FORCES ACROSS THE NATION STRUGGLE WITH SUBJECT OR TARGET DECONFLICTION. THIS PROJECT WILL INCORPORATE INTELLIGENCE SUBMISSIONS/TARGET DE-CONFLICTION INTO THE NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES OF PARTICIPATING TASK FORCE AGENCIES. PSEUDOEPHEDRINE TRACKINGTHE NATIONAL PRECURSOR LOG EXCHANGE (NPLEX) IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED WITH 891 REGISTERED ENFORCEMENT USERS AND 656 PHARMACISTS.
