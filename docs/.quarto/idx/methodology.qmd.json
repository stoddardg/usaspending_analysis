Grants which we find to be a \"match\" may be intended for purposes other than violence prevention, as indicated in their descriptions (e.g., grants for the purchase of body-worn cameras). On the other hand, there may be some grants where the description field is left blank, or where there is a typo, that are in fact related to violence prevention (e.g. there are many Cops Hiring Program grants where the description reads \"CHP\" but the two columns identified above are blank).\n\nAs a result, we believe we are both over-counting and under-counting our grant inclusion. To remedy this, more sophisticated text analysis may be implemented in future iterations.\n\n\n## Analysis Decisions\n\nFor the sake of data transparency, we have documented several key analytical decisions made during the data processing for this dashboard.\n\n1. **Exclusion of State Government Grants**: We excluded grants awarded to state governments, focusing instead on resources locally available to cities.\n2. **Data Date Ranges**: The USA Spend data are based on date ranges. We exported data based on the Action Date to determine the year a grant was awarded. We included only grant entries where the `action_type_description` field is \"New,\" thereby excluding entries labeled as \"Revision\" or \"Adjustment.\"\n3. **City Selection for Demonstration**: For this demonstration, we selected a random set of cities with high gun violence rates.
