## Defining "Violence Prevention Related" Grants

We have defined violence prevention related grants based on the guidance and definitions [provided by the Biden Harris administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CVI-Funding-Resources.pdf) on May 22, 2024.

At present, we have found relevant grant matches from USASpending.gov in four departments: Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Justice, and Department of Labor. We were able to source grant matches for the following specific programs:


**DOE**

- 21st Century Learning Centers
- Education Innovation and Research Program
- Full Service Community Schools
- Promise Neighborhoods
- Student Support and Academic Enrichment


**DOJ**

- Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation
- Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant
- Community Policing Development Micro-Grants
- Community Violence Intervention And Prevention Initiative
- Cops Hiring Program
- Project Safe Neighborhood
- School Violence Prevention Program
- Second Chance Act Community Based Re-Entry Program
- Smart Policing
- Strategies To Support Children Exposed To Violence
- Victims of Crime Act (VOCA)


**HUD**

- Choice Neighborhoods
- Community Development and Block Grants


**Labor**

- Re-Entry Employment
- Youth Build
- Youth Employment


Given the data that we downloaded from USASpending.gov, we determined program matches by searching the following two columns: `program_activities_funding_this_award` and `cfda_title`. In some cases, one or both of these columns are blank.

Across all US cities, we were able to match just over 22,000 total grants with grant categories as listed above. Of these, around 75% were matched based on `program_activities_funding_this_award`, and the other 25% were matched based on `cfda_title`.


## Additional Caveats and Warnings

This methodology to determine whether a grant is related to violence prevention is based solely on category and does not consider the grant description. Grants which we find to be a "match" may be intended for purposes other than violence prevention, as indicated in their descriptions (e.g., grants for the purchase of body-worn cameras). On the other hand, there may be some grants where the description field is left blank, or where there is a typo, that are in fact related to violence prevention (e.g. there are many Cops Hiring Program grants where the description reads "CHP" but the two columns identified above are blank).

As a result, we believe we are both over-counting and under-counting our grant inclusion. To remedy this, more sophisticated text analysis may be implemented in future iterations.


## Analysis Decisions

For the sake of data transparency, we have documented several key analytical decisions made during the data processing for this dashboard.

1. **Exclusion of State Government Grants**: We excluded grants awarded to state governments, focusing instead on resources locally available to cities.
2. **Data Date Ranges**: The USA Spend data are based on date ranges. We exported data based on the Action Date to determine the year a grant was awarded. We included only grant entries where the `action_type_description` field is "New," thereby excluding entries labeled as "Revision" or "Adjustment."
3. **City Selection for Demonstration**: For this demonstration, we selected a random set of cities with high gun violence rates. The cities displayed can be changed in future iterations.
