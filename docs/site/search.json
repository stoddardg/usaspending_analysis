    "text": "Additional Caveats and Warnings\nThis methodology to determine whether a grant is related to violence prevention is based solely on category and does not consider the grant description. Grants which we find to be a “match” may be intended for purposes other than violence prevention, as indicated in their descriptions (e.g., grants for the purchase of body-worn cameras). On the other hand, there may be some grants where the description field is left blank, or where there is a typo, that are in fact related to violence prevention (e.g. there are many Cops Hiring Program grants where the description reads “CHP” but the two columns identified above are blank).\nAs a result, we believe we are both over-counting and under-counting our grant inclusion. To remedy this, more sophisticated text analysis may be implemented in future iterations."

We exported data based on the Action Date to determine the year a grant was awarded. We included only grant entries where the action_type_description field is “New,” thereby excluding entries labeled as “Revision” or “Adjustment.”\nCity Selection for Demonstration: For this demonstration, we selected a random set of cities with high gun violence rates. The cities displayed can be changed in future iterations."

    "text": "This is a demo website, created by the UChicago Crime Lab, to analyze grant funding in 15 American cities, specifically to better understand the amount of funds being allocated to violence prevention related programs. We focused on 21 grant programs identified by the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention which are related to violence prevention. (To read the White House press release, please click here.)\nFor each city, we have created a funding page, as well as an analysis page. The funding page doesn’t contain any data analytics, and is meant to allow cities to easily access information pertaining to their individual grants. The analysis page provides more detail, and specifically, compares grant funding to similar cities to identify potential future places for grant applications.\nPlease note that everything on this website is considered a first pass analysis, and should not be taken to reflect fully accurate numbers."
