    "text": "For the sake of data transparency, we have documented several key analytical decisions made during the data processing for this dashboard.\n\nExclusion of State Government Grants: We excluded grants awarded to state governments, focusing instead on resources locally available to cities.\nPrimary Awards Inclusion: Currently, only primary awards are included. Our roadmap includes incorporating sub-award data, which will allow for more granular analysis of fund distribution by geography.\nGrant Categorization: Categorization is based on the program_activities_funding_this_award and cfda_title data fields. These columns are not always present and may use inconsistent naming conventions; therefore, the categorization should be considered with caution.\nViolence Prevention Determinations: The determination of whether a grant is related to violence prevention is based solely on category and does not consider the grant description. Grants may be intended for purposes other than violence prevention, as indicated in their descriptions (e.g., grants for the purchase of body-worn cameras). Future iterations will address this labeling challenge in more detail.\nData Date Ranges: The USA Spend data are based on date ranges. We exported data based on the Action Date to determine the year a grant was awarded. We included only grant entries where the action_type_description field is âNew,â thereby excluding entries labeled as âRevisionâ or âAdjustment.â\nCity Selection for Demonstration: For this demonstration, we selected a random set of cities with high gun violence rates. The cities displayed can be changed in future iterations."
