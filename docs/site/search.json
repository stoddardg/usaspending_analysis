    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a demo website, created by the UChicago Crime Lab, to analyze DOJ grant funding to cities from the USA spending page. This is an attempt to better understand the amount of funds being allocated to violence prevention related programs.\nPlease note that everything on this website is considered a first pass analysis, and should not be taken to reflect fully accurate numbers. Ongoing work is being done to analyze where there may be incorrect labeling, either over- or under-representing the true amount of funding going into these areas for the cities being considered.\n\nData Sources:\n\nDOJ Grant Funding comes from USASpending.gov\nGun violence data comes from americanviolence.org\n\n\n\nAnalysis Decisions\nFor the sake of data transparency, we have documented several key analytical decisions made during the data processing for this dashboard.\n\nExclusion of State Government Grants: We excluded grants awarded to state governments, focusing instead on resources locally available to cities.\nPrimary Awards Inclusion: Currently, only primary awards are included. Our roadmap includes incorporating sub-award data, which will allow for more granular analysis of fund distribution by geography.\nGrant Categorization: Categorization is based on the program_activities_funding_this_award and cfda_title data fields. These columns are not always present and may use inconsistent naming conventions; therefore, the categorization should be considered with caution.\nViolence Prevention Determinations: The determination of whether a grant is related to violence prevention is based solely on category and does not consider the grant description. Grants may be intended for purposes other than violence prevention, as indicated in their descriptions (e.g., grants for the purchase of body-worn cameras). Future iterations will address this labeling challenge in more detail.\nData Date Ranges: The USA Spend data are based on date ranges. We exported data based on the Action Date to determine the year a grant was awarded. We included only grant entries where the action_type_description field is “New,” thereby excluding entries labeled as “Revision” or “Adjustment.”\nCity Selection for Demonstration: For this demonstration, we selected a random set of cities with high gun violence rates. The cities displayed can be changed in future iterations."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nObligated fund amounts are aggregated over all fiscal years FY ’19 - FY ’24 (though FY ’24 has very minimal data). Average annual fatal shootings per year take the 5-year average from American Violence, averaging from 2019-2023, then dividing by 5. American Violence also supplies the average annual population and fatal shooting per 100k rates, both across the same time period (2019-2023). Finally, Total/Violence Prevention Related Funds Per Fatal Shooting are calculated by taking the total Overall/Violence Prevention-related funding amount and dividing by the total number of fatal shootings. Since both are over a 5-year period, this averages out to total dollars per fatal shooting.↩︎"
