Then, we look at the total funding value for the closest 5 cities (absolute distance) via three metrics: average population, number of fatal shootings, and number of shootings per 100k residents.\nFor example, the closest 5 cities by population to Washington (which had a population of 694,741 people) were:\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana (878,020 people)\nDallas, Texas (1,321,780 people)\nNew Orleans, Louisiana (387,417 people)\nSaint Louis, Missouri (302,217 people)\nDetroit, Michigan (655,330 people)\n\n\n\nFor the closest cities by population, we show in red the grant categories where washington is relatively under-funded, and in green, those where it is relatively over-funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Grant Source\n      Total Funds\n      Closest 5: Avg Population\n      Closest 5: Fatal Shootings\n      Closest 5: Shootings/100k\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.1.0 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)"

Then, we look at the total funding value for the closest 5 cities (absolute distance) via three metrics: average population, number of fatal shootings, and number of shootings per 100k residents.\nFor example, the closest 5 cities by population to Phoenix (which had a population of 1,629,759 people) were:\n\nLos Angeles, California (3,934,207 people)\nColumbus, Ohio (899,799 people)\nCleveland, Ohio (377,543 people)\nAtlanta, Georgia (499,094 people)\nKansas City, Missouri (499,908 people)\n\n\n\nFor the closest cities by population, we show in red the grant categories where phoenix is relatively under-funded, and in green, those where it is relatively over-funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Grant Source\n      Total Funds\n      Closest 5: Avg Population\n      Closest 5: Fatal Shootings\n      Closest 5: Shootings/100k\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.1.0 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)"

    "text": "This is a demo website, created by the UChicago Crime Lab, to analyze DOJ grant funding to cities from USASpending.gov. This is an attempt to better understand the amount of funds being allocated to violence prevention related programs.\nPlease note that everything on this website is considered a first pass analysis, and should not be taken to reflect fully accurate numbers. Ongoing work is being done to analyze where there may be incorrect labeling, either over- or under-representing the true amount of funding going into these areas for the cities being considered.\n\nData Sources:\n\nDOJ Grant Funding comes from USASpending.gov\nGun violence data comes from americanviolence.org\n\n\n\nAnalysis Decisions\nFor the sake of data transparency, we have documented several key analytical decisions made during the data processing for this dashboard.\n\nExclusion of State Government Grants: We excluded grants awarded to state governments, focusing instead on resources locally available to cities.\nPrimary Awards Inclusion: Currently, only primary awards are included. Our roadmap includes incorporating sub-award data, which will allow for more granular analysis of fund distribution by geography.\nGrant Categorization: Categorization is based on the program_activities_funding_this_award and cfda_title data fields. These columns are not always present and may use inconsistent naming conventions; therefore, the categorization should be considered with caution.\nViolence Prevention Determinations: The determination of whether a grant is related to violence prevention is based solely on category and does not consider the grant description. Grants may be intended for purposes other than violence prevention, as indicated in their descriptions (e.g., grants for the purchase of body-worn cameras). Future iterations will address this labeling challenge in more detail.\nData Date Ranges: The USA Spend data are based on date ranges. We exported data based on the Action Date to determine the year a grant was awarded. We included only grant entries where the action_type_description field is “New,” thereby excluding entries labeled as “Revision” or “Adjustment.”\nCity Selection for Demonstration: For this demonstration, we selected a random set of cities with high gun violence rates. The cities displayed can be changed in future iterations."

Then, we look at the total funding value for the closest 5 cities (absolute distance) via three metrics: average population, number of fatal shootings, and number of shootings per 100k residents.\nFor example, the closest 5 cities by population to Chicago (which had a population of 2,722,400 people) were:\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania (1,592,615 people)\nHouston, Texas (2,309,887 people)\nBaltimore, Maryland (594,084 people)\nMemphis, Tennessee (640,289 people)\nNew York, New York (8,565,298 people)\n\n\n\nFor the closest cities by population, we show in red the grant categories where chicago is relatively under-funded, and in green, those where it is relatively over-funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Grant Source\n      Total Funds\n      Closest 5: Avg Population\n      Closest 5: Fatal Shootings\n      Closest 5: Shootings/100k\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.1.0 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)"

Then, we look at the total funding value for the closest 5 cities (absolute distance) via three metrics: average population, number of fatal shootings, and number of shootings per 100k residents.\nFor example, the closest 5 cities by population to Baton Rouge (which had a population of 223,520 people) were:\n\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico (562,111 people)\nCharlotte, North Carolina (874,624 people)\nOakland, California (433,089 people)\nFort Worth, Texas (909,824 people)\nCincinnati, Ohio (306,761 people)\n\n\n\nFor the closest cities by population, we show in red the grant categories where baton rouge is relatively under-funded, and in green, those where it is relatively over-funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Grant Source\n      Total Funds\n      Closest 5: Avg Population\n      Closest 5: Fatal Shootings\n      Closest 5: Shootings/100k\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.1.0 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)"

Then, we look at the total funding value for the closest 5 cities (absolute distance) via three metrics: average population, number of fatal shootings, and number of shootings per 100k residents.\nFor example, the closest 5 cities by population to Atlanta (which had a population of 499,094 people) were:\n\nCleveland, Ohio (377,543 people)\nKansas City, Missouri (499,908 people)\nPhoenix, Arizona (1,629,759 people)\nLos Angeles, California (3,934,207 people)\nColumbus, Ohio (899,799 people)\n\n\n\nFor the closest cities by population, we show in red the grant categories where atlanta is relatively under-funded, and in green, those where it is relatively over-funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Grant Source\n      Total Funds\n      Closest 5: Avg Population\n      Closest 5: Fatal Shootings\n      Closest 5: Shootings/100k\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.1.0 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)"

Then, we look at the total funding value for the closest 5 cities (absolute distance) via three metrics: average population, number of fatal shootings, and number of shootings per 100k residents.\nFor example, the closest 5 cities by population to Birmingham (which had a population of 205,718 people) were:\n\nJacksonville, Florida (928,240 people)\nSan Antonio, Texas (1,481,669 people)\nColumbus, Ohio (899,799 people)\nLos Angeles, California (3,934,207 people)\nOakland, California (433,089 people)\n\n\n\nFor the closest cities by population, we show in red the grant categories where birmingham is relatively under-funded, and in green, those where it is relatively over-funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Grant Source\n      Total Funds\n      Closest 5: Avg Population\n      Closest 5: Fatal Shootings\n      Closest 5: Shootings/100k\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.1.0 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)"

Then, we look at the total funding value for the closest 5 cities (absolute distance) via three metrics: average population, number of fatal shootings, and number of shootings per 100k residents.\nFor example, the closest 5 cities by population to Detroit (which had a population of 655,330 people) were:\n\nSaint Louis, Missouri (302,217 people)\nDallas, Texas (1,321,780 people)\nIndianapolis, Indiana (878,020 people)\nWashington, District Of Columbia (694,741 people)\nNew Orleans, Louisiana (387,417 people)\n\n\n\nFor the closest cities by population, we show in red the grant categories where detroit is relatively under-funded, and in green, those where it is relatively over-funded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Grant Source\n      Total Funds\n      Closest 5: Avg Population\n      Closest 5: Fatal Shootings\n      Closest 5: Shootings/100k\n    \n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nLoading ITables v2.1.0 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)"

Average annual fatal shootings per year take the 5-year average from American Violence, averaging from 2019-2023, then dividing by 5. American Violence also supplies the average annual population and fatal shooting per 100k rates, both across the same time period (2019-2023). Finally, Total/Violence Prevention Related Funds Per Fatal Shooting are calculated by taking the total Overall/Violence Prevention-related funding amount and dividing by the total number of fatal shootings. Since both are over a 5-year period, this averages out to total dollars per fatal shooting.↩︎"
