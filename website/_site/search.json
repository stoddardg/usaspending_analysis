Average annual fatal shootings per year take the 5-year average from American Violence, averaging from 2019-2023, then dividing by 5. American Violence also supplies the average annual population and fatal shooting per 100k rates, both across the same time period (2019-2023). Finally, Total/Violence Prevention Related Funds Per Fatal Shooting are calculated by taking the total Overall/Violence Prevention-related funding amount and dividing by the total number of fatal shootings. Since both are over a 5-year period, this averages out to total dollars per fatal shooting.↩︎"
